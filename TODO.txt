- Write raw byte arrays byte-aligned?
	- Add a Bytes type that is written byte-aligned?
	- Add a ByteAlign type that is logically empty but inserts enough bits to byte-align the next item? (+1, seems most generic)
	- Add ArrayType.ByteAlign?
- Map type
- Add generic types?  Use cases: AuthRequest[T], AuthResponse[T], CacheRequest[T], CacheResponse[T]. 
	- Is metadata a better solution to these problems?  A protocol could specify its allowed metadata, instead of it being arbitrary (like HTTP, gRPC).
	- Since these use cases come in XRequest/XResponse pairs, they would decorate functions or whole protocols.  The decorators are second-order functions.
- Store packages on disk as Any values, so they are self-describing (or rather, self-identifying).

- Add DisplayIndex to StructField and EnumElement (for documentation purposes only - serialization order is array order)?
- typEd UI design idea:  lay out types just as they would be positioned in a text format (indented lines of text) and with similar keyboard navigation, for familiarity's sake
