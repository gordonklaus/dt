- Store ints as 8 payload bits + 1 continuation bit?
- Store packages on disk as Any values, so they are self-describing (or rather, self-identifying).
- Add generic types?  Use cases: AuthRequest[T], AuthResponse[T], CacheRequest[T], CacheResponse[T]. 
	- Is metadata a better solution to these problems?  A protocol could specify its allowed metadata, instead of it being arbitrary (like HTTP, gRPC).
	- Since these use cases come in XRequest/XResponse pairs, they would decorate functions or whole protocols.  The decorators are second-order functions.
- Add Index (int64 (signed!)) to StructField and EnumElement and allow fields and elements to be reordered (for documentation purposes only - serialization order is determined by one or the other)?
- Map type
- typEd UI design idea:  lay out types just as they would be positioned in a text format (indented lines of text) and with similar keyboard navigation, for familiarity's sake
