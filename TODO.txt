- Enforce compatibility:
	- When deleting an item that has not just been added (in this commit, or on this branch (configurable)), deprecate the item instead.
- Add a ByteAlign[T] type that inserts enough bits to byte-align its value.
	- Be explicit: insert zero or more ones followed by a zero so that the reader can validate alignment.
	- Benchmark: how much does this speed up reading large arrays?
- Add generic types?  Use cases: AuthRequest[T], AuthResponse[T], CacheRequest[T], CacheResponse[T]. 
	- Is metadata a better solution to these problems?  A protocol could specify its allowed metadata, instead of it being arbitrary (like HTTP, gRPC).
	- Since these use cases come in XRequest/XResponse pairs, they would decorate functions or whole protocols.  The decorators are second-order functions.
- Add (optional) (mutable?) {String,Array,Map}.MaxSize to prevent generated readers from allocating arbitrarily large amounts of memory.
	- Readers and writers should fail if this size is exceeded.
		- Writers need to return an error (probably a good design, anyway), or String,Array,Map setters should validate size.
	- Or, better: readers should only allocate some maximum (configurable) size initially, and grow this size as elements are read.  This way, the actual allocated size is limited by the payload size.
		- bits.Buffer.ReadString should follow the same strategy.
		- The initial size can be based on the size of the remaining buffer to be read (and an error can be returned if this is exceeded).

- In the TypeEditor menu, show enum elements under a submenu.
- Add DisplayIndex to StructField and EnumElement (for documentation purposes only - serialization order is array order)?
